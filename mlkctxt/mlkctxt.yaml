# Variable paths are converted into case-insensitive envvars, so don't rely on
# case to differentiate variables or paths. Do not end variable paths with the
# reserved words "default" or "NOTNULL".

# WARNING! Don't use "-" in variable paths.

# Use $[SYSTEM.a.b]$ to reference a path in the system context. Use $[a.b.c]$
# to reference local variables.
# Use ${command}$ to launch shell commands, like for example ${date}$. However,
# this process executes in a blank environment.
# References to another variable paths and commands can be safely mixed in a
# variable.
# Reference variables in .mlkctxt_template files with [{a.b.c}].

# Refer to ENVVARS in scripts using paths without context with the mlkp command,
# like in:
#   mlkp a.b.c
#   mlkp SYSTEM.a.b.c

# The list of available context. The "system", "SYSTEM", "default", and
# "NOTNULL" context names are reserved and can't be used. This section is
# optional if there are no other contexts aside the default one. There is no
# need to specify the default context anyway.
